Biz Sys 2 Assignments

Hey group, I uploaded our assignments as a ZIP file. You'll want to download GroupThreeAssignments.zip then import it into your IDE (Eclipse, NetBeans, etc.) If everything goes smoothly there should be a Java project titled "GroupThreeAssignments", a package titled "groupthreeAsg1", and 2 classes titled "EOQCalculator" and "TestEOQCalculator".

I haven't added much yet (just a couple of methods, scanner, and welcome message) but it's a start. Let me know if you have any questions!
